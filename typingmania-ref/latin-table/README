Latin Table
===========

TypingMania NEO only allow limited ASCII character to be typed in the game.
However, song lyrics often include other character for styling, etc. Including
Japanese lyrics, the Latin Table provide translation between each character
and its appropriate latin character.

While build-csv.js script was initially use for seeding the CSV table,
the final table was enhanced by hand so do not re-run the script if you
do not know what you are doing.

Available mapping table:
 - `japanese-kana` : Japanese Hiragana and Katakana
    (Unicode BMP "Hiragana" and "Katakana")
 - `japanese-katakana-half` : Half Width Katakana
    (Second half of Unicode BMP "Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms")
 - `cjk-symbol` : CJK Symbol
 - `full-width` : Full Width Latin Character/Symbol
    (First half of Unicode BMP "Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms")
 - `enclosed-alnum` : Enclosed form
   (Unicode BMP "Enclosed Alphanumerics" and partially "Enclosed CJK Letters and Months")
 - `latin-extended` : Unicode BMP: Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B, Latin Extended Additional
 - `quote` : Smart Quatation Mark
   (Unicode "Quotation Mark=Yes")

The main modifications by hand are:

 - Full-width space and Japanese quotation mark 「」『』 map to empty string
   to flow better with the song lyrics. Of course, typing space
   or [ ] is also accepted as valid.
 - Add reading for multiple kana, and for small kana by itself.
 - Special handling for っ ッ ゝ ゞ ヽ ヾ
 - And a bit more I might have forgot to make a note of.
